# Perceived Cohesion Example

This file attempts to reproduce the perceived cohesion example in Chapter 5.

### Data

The raw dataset is transported from SAS. Here we only need the final data file coehsion_clean.csv and cohesion_clean.txt. The former is for R and the latter is for Mplus.

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis

Ch5_Cohesion_2SLS.Rmd is a Rmarkdown file. It produces the covariance matrix and the 2SLS estimates for the model.

cohesion_ML.inp is for Mplus. It produces the Maximum Likelihood estimates for the model.
