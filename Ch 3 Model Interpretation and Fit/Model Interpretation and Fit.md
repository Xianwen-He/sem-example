# Model Interpretation and Fit

This file attempts to re-create the analyses of Ken Bollen's SEM Chapter 3
regression models of education.

### Data

gss2010merged_r2b.dta is the initial data file we use. Run GSS Regression.do to process data. The data for analysis will be stored in GSSEx.dta and GSSExMp.txt for Stata and Mplus respectively. GSS Regression.do also contains a full regression model.

### Regression

The results for the full model in Stata is stored in GSS Regression.txt.

GSS Reg M1.inp~GSS Reg M4.inp are codes for M1~M4.
